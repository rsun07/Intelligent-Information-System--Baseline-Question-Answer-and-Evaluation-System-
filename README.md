A key component of Watson, IBMâ€™s QA system  
My project in Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), School of Computer Science (SCS), Language Technologies Institute (LTI)  

 - Designed and implemented a pipeline to recognize the semantic entity from large input documents
 - Built a retrieval system in multiple retrieval approaches  such as Vector Space Retrival, Dice Coefficient, Jaccard Coefficient and Okapi BM25 with TF-IDF.
 - Evaluated and compared the performance of each approach separately and also the performance of all integrative approaches using the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR).
 - Learnt and used a number of Nature Language Processing (NLP) tools to pre-processing the row material to improve the precision.
 - 47.3% improvement achieved in precision during error analysis.
