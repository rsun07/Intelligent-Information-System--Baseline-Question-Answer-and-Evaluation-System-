A key component of Watson, IBMâ€™s QA system  
My project at Carnegie Mellon University, School of Computer Science  

I Built a retrieval system in multiple approaches; 
During the processes, I learnt and used a number of Nature Language Processing (NLP) tools to pre-processing the row material to improve the precision. I also tried different retrieval functions such as Vector Space Retrival, Dice Coefficient, Jaccard Coefficient and Okapi BM25 with TF-IDF. 
I evaluated and compared the performance of each approach separatly and also the performance of all integrative approaches using the Mean Reciprocal Rank.
I acheieved 47.3% improvement in precision  during error analysis.
